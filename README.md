# Algorithms and Data Structures
Laboratories and projects from my university course Algorithms and Data Structures

## What I learned:
- Sorting Algorithms.
  - Insertion Sort.
  - Selection Sort.
  - Merge Sort
  - Heap Sort.
  - Quick Sort.
  - Radix Sort.
- Priority Queue.
- Hash Table.
- Autobalanced Trees.
- Graphs.
- Calculating $O(n)$.
- Good Algorithms where $O(n) < n * log(n)$.

## Tools Used:
- C++
